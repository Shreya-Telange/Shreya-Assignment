# Shreya-Assignment
This is the assignment from Banfield's Professional Medical English and I completed this assignment using html css and javascript.  

This HTML code outlines a webpage for a course titled "OET Preparation" offered by ProMedicalEnglish. 

1. Document Structure: The code begins with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, indicating that this is an HTML5 document. It specifies the language as English with <html lang="en">.

2. Head Section: Contains metadata, including character set (UTF-8), viewport settings for responsive design, and the title of the page. It links to an external stylesheet (styles.css) for styling.

3. Body Section: This is the main content area of the webpage.

   - Header: Features the main title ("OET Preparation for Healthcare Professionals") and a call-to-action button for enrollment.
   
   - Features Section: Highlights key features and benefits of the course, such as expert-led sessions and tailored practice tests.
   
   - Course Structure Section: Details the course modules, providing a brief overview of each module (e.g., Introduction to OET, Speaking Skills).
   
   - Testimonials Section: Includes quotes from students who have taken the course, showcasing positive feedback and experiences.
   
   - FAQ Section: Answers common questions, like course duration and support availability.

4. Footer: Contains contact information, including an email and phone number, as well as navigation links to other sections of the site (About Us, Contact, Privacy Policy).

5. Script Tag: Links to an external JavaScript file (scripts.js) for additional functionality, though it's not detailed in the provided code.

Overall, this code presents a structured and informative layout aimed at promoting and providing details about an OET preparation course.

In CSS code I use Media Queries  ensure that the website looks responsive and  adapts well across different screen sizes, maintaining readability and usability.  

Then I use Javascript code for the Module section,Testinomal section and the FAQ section to add some interactive functionalities.
